## APIs

are Application Programming Interfaces. Bascially a way for applications to talk to each other. Let's say we have an Uber app that uses Google Maps, but Uber and Google are completely different companies so how did Uber get their hands on Google Maps? Well, Google Maps has an API in the form of HTTP requests that can be made to Google Maps (with some $$ of course) to get information. 


## Example: Github Apps

Github Apps are apps that can be installed on a github repo that respond to events that happen within a repo. For this example I've creeated a simple app using the Protobot framework in JavaScript. It uses the Github API to perform actions on this repo!
