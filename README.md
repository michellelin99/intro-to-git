# intro-to-git

Hi! This is an introduction to git and github. 

# Git
Git is a version control system.

Basic commands:
`git clone` to copy a repository of code into your local environment. 
`git add <file>` to put a file on the list of things to change/update (into staging).
`git commit -m <message here>` to capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
`git push` to push the changes from your local environment to the shared repository of code.

# Github
Github is platform that hosts code and uses git.

There's a lot of cool stuff here like seeing all the work that everybody has done, adding in CI/CD, etc.

# IMPORTANT
`Git != Github`
